                                        <p>In Junot Diaz’s “The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao”, Dominican masculinity is an important theme throughout the book that deeply influences the unfolding of the plot.  The main male character Oscar – is described as a “loser” being very concerned with fulfilling typical Dominican male sexual standards. One of the main reason that causes Oscar’s plight throughout the story is his inability to embody the role of the Dominican male both physically and mentally. Oscar’s only ambition is to find a woman who can return his love but he fails to achieve the goal because of the lack of necessary masculine qualities. On the contrast, another key male character Yunior’s plight is his excessive masculinity. Yunior is such a charming ladies’ man under Dominican standards and also because of this, he is unable to maintain a relationship with Lola due to the lack of loyalty and responsibility to his partner. Oscar and Yunior are opposite when it comes to Dominican masculinity. By constructing the character Oscar who seeks to fill in the gap between the sexual cultural practices of Dominican culture and his own perception of masculinity, also by implementing the comparison and contrast between Oscar and a typical Dominican masculinity representative Yunior, the author Junot Diaz explores the possibility and the establishment of an emerging masculinity under the long shadow of Trujillo dictatorship that differs from the Dominican stereotype. </p>
                
                                        <p> Broadly speaking, through reading The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao, one can have an impression that gender difference determines the fate of the characters. Whereas Oscar is an example of failing to map out the Dominican masculinity, the author Diaz gives readers a general idea of traditional Dominican masculine standards by describing Trujillo’s dictatorship, Yunior’s unfaithfulness and other male characters’ brutal actions towards women, which are male-centered, daring and aggressive. Dominican men reinforce their masculinity by rejecting femininity, the power stems from the their ability to seduce and possess women in large numbers. It is also worth noting that, within the frame of the traditional representation of masculinity in the Dominican Republic constructed in the novel, standard Dominican masculinity shows no tolerance of feminine qualities, male feebleness and homosexuality. When Oscar moves to college and his mother gives him a gift: “[i]n September he headed to Rutgers New Brunswick, his mother gave him a hundred dollars and his first kiss in five years, his tio a box of condoms: Use them all, he said, and then added: On girls.”[49]
                                        </p>

                                        <p>The novel also validates the idea that in Trujillo’s era, the rejection of homosexuality is clearly rejected and opposed. In the novel, Trujillo has come up with a false rumor and accuses Abelard of being homosexual to discredit him in the eye of Dominican elites. “- I have seen you here often, Doctor, but lately with your wife. Have you divorced her? – I am still married, Your Enormity. – That is good to hear, El Jefe said, I was afraid that you might have turned into un maricon. Then  he turned to the lambesacos an laughed. Oh, Jefe, they screamed, you are too much.” [222] One can also conclude that males’ respectability depends undoubtedly on heterosexuality and their ability on females to brag about. This is only a small instance of Trujillo’s profound influence on the formation of the Dominican Republic’s gender values: diversified emotions and sexualities are not allowed, only male is the center of the society. Also, under Trujillo’s dictatorship, along with the supernatural power imposed to the nation, there is no doubt that Trujillo’s behavior and his value of Dominican masculinity will be imitated and inherited. Trujillo is very effective at bragging publicly about women because “If you think Dominican guy’s bad, Trujillo was five thousand times worse. Dude had hundreds of spies whose entire job was to scour the provinces for his next piece of ass”[217]  And at the very beginning of the book, in Diaz’s footnote, readers get to know that Trujillo is a “mixture of violence, intimidation, massacre, rape, co-optation, and terror” who “bleached his skin, wore platform shoes, and had a fondness for Napoleon-era haberdashery” and also “control[s] every aspect of the DR’s political, cultural, social and economic life”.[2] It is not hard to imagine that, with such kind of long dictatorship of Trujillo, Dominican masculinity is deeply affected by Trujillo.</p>

                                        <p>And the main character Oscar has been constantly struggling with the ideological consequences of Trujillo’s dictatorship in Dominican’s gender identities. In the first part of the novel, the narration informs the readers of Oscar’s emotional involvement with Maritza and Olga by the age of seven. At that precise moment, the narrator describes Oscar as “something of a Casanova”[11] and his engagement with girls sounds promising within the parameters of Dominican culture: “[l]ook at that little macho. His mother’s friend said. Que hombre”.[14] Once again, the narrator describes Oscar in flattering terms, but this time his words anticipate Oscar’s fall from grace: “[i]t truly was a Golden Age for Oscar, one that reached its apotheosis in the fall of his seventh year, when he had two little girlfriends at the same time, his first and only ménage à trois”.[13]  However, from that moment onwards, Oscar is in torment and trapped in his particular fukú because his emotional landscape becomes bleak. As a proof of this, Yunior abandons his cool tone in the narration of Oscar’s life to move onto one of despair. </p>

                                        <p>The change first occurs to Oscar’s appearance, the cute, charming little boy becomes a fat, pimply, curly-haired, wearing weird glasses nerd. This change of Oscar’s appearance suggests a break with the conventions of masculinity in a traditional male-centered culture. It causes a state of desperation in Lola to the point that she voices her inner concern that he will “die a virgin unless [he] starts changing”.[25] Considering Lola’s remark, the development of sexuality occupies a central position in the minds of Dominicans at a pre-mature stage in their lives. Reading only the beginning part of Oscar’s story, one can already sense that there exists an ongoing prejudice against non-normative masculinity within his family and on the society. Lola representing this Dominican family seeks to replace Oscar’s kind-hearted, genuine nature by a more appealing and masculine one in the eyes of Dominicans. His good virtues are regarded as his major weaknesses rather than the source of positive qualities of Dominican masculinity. In this part of the story, Oscar starts to become a trouble and a challenge to this tradition that is sensed in huge development of his personality. </p>

                                        <p>Oscar does not passively accept the fact that he is getting far away from the standard Dominican masculinity. He tries many things to make up for the lack of Dominican masculine qualities, especially the effort of approaching girls and trying hard to make himself look good in front of girls. However, Oscar is special, being a typical popular Dominican man is not the only thing he wants. Though he has been constantly struggling to fulfil the Dominican manhood standard during his growing up. He also develops his own view in masculine qualities from his sci-fi world and being in the United States which forms an internal contracts within Oscar’s mind. There are weirdly two kinds of dreams Oscar normally has, the dream to become a superhero and win the girl’s heart and the dream to become a traditionally regarded rich and successful man. The two seemingly irrelevant dreams both occur in Oscar’s mind which implies the constant battling he has between his sci-fi world and the traditional Dominican culture. “In his dreams he was either saving them from aliens or he was returning to the neighborhood, rich and famous – It’s him!” [27] But the two kinds of dreams still don’t go beyond the scope of a traditional setting of masculinity: being strong, powerful and rich. As the plot develops, Oscar problematizes his failed attempts to become a womanizer, an object of female desire and a well-rounded Dominican “macho”. However, all these attributes are essentially drawn together in the construction of the character Yunior which is a representative of standard Dominican masculinity. </p>

                                        <p>Yunior – the narrator in the novel, who is a charming adventurous guy. He is roommate of Oscar and boyfriend of Lola. He is also portrayed as a man who is unable to remain in the relationship with Lola due to his greedy sexual desire, and does not show regret for his unfaithfulness and the pain imposed on Lola. However, this image is accepted in the Dominican Republic society, and is thought as standard Dominican masculinity. Yunior as a representation of Dominican masculinity tends to consider females as objects to show their masculine power. Also, as the narrator of the story, Yunior holds a power position by the fact that he is the one in charge of narrating Oscar’s tragic life, and Yunior did actually strengthen Oscar’s clumsiness in controlling women, “dude never had much luck with the female (how very un-Dominican of him)”. [11]</p>

                                        <p>Despite the differences between Yunior and Oscar, the fact that Yunior writes down Oscar’s story also shows readers their unusual friendship. Oscar grows up without a male figure in his life. Yunior also explains that Oscar’s being feminized is partly due to the absence of a male figure during his upbringing, “it wasn’t just that he didn’t have no kind of father to show him the masculine ropes, he simply lacked all aggressive and martial tendencies”.[15]  Naturally, Yunior becomes a “brother” Oscar can talk with and makes Oscar not as tragic as one can imagine. More importantly, for Yunior, Oscar provides an alternative model of masculinity consisting of a different set of qualities which are more emotional and more “feminized”. In Oscar’s standard of masculinity, violence is out of his emotional world, in contrast to other males in the story. He never makes use of violence to any female characters. One important distinction on Oscar’s masculinity is the ability to admit male’s feminized qualities. Throughout the story, readers know that Oscar can seem feminized, he is sensitive and romantic, he “cried for his love of some girl”[24] and  he even commits suicide when he is dumped by a girl. But it is undeniable that he is also a brave man with masculine power when he makes the speech about his persistence on love before he dies. Another distinction against traditional Dominican masculinity derived from Oscar is how much he cares about love and how much he respects women compared to other Dominican male characters in the story. Every time Oscar has a chance for a romance, he thought it was going to be “his last fxxking chane for happiness”, [47]. The same applies even to Ybon the middle-aged prostitute. Apparently, Oscar is a good listener who also knows to appreciate females, he sits for six hours to listen to Ybon’s stories. Oscar is so persistent in love that he believes in the fantasy that the love between this experienced woman and him is his last chance of acquiring mature masculinity and acceptance by the society. The fantasy is misleading that leads to the end of Oscar’s life, however, also approved by Yunior as an evidence of Oscar’s masculinity.</p>
